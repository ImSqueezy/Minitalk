Minitalk is about a acheiving a mini Communication between two processes. There will be a process waiting for a messages and other just sends what ever message is passed alongside the arguments.

# Execution
- This version works only on Linux Operating Systems.
- (Minitalk has two Executable, server and client)
- (This project has a Makefile so you would need to 'make' as well, 'make bonus' for the bonus)

## Server
Execute server using the Syntax:
'/.Server' or ./server_bonus
1) It'll print its pid on your Screen
2) Copy that, and pass it to the client's execution's arguments.

## Client
Syntax:
'./client PID MESSAGE' or './client_bonus PID MESSAGE' and watch the magic.
